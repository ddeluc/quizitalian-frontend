            Hey there!
        
            My name is Dante and I am a software engineering student from Canada with a
            passion for language learning and I've made Quizshare to help people learn Italian from text that 
            they find interesting. For example, If you are reading a book or an article, add the text to a 
            module and quiz yourself on the grammar and vocabulary.

            Thank you for giving my app try! If you have any suggestions feel free to contact me at my email
            dantedeluca3219@icloud.com

            Cheers!
            </Typography>
